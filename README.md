# warGames - A simple game built with SVG and CSS

This homage to the classic 1983 movie "warGames" uses only one SVG file and CSS to create a game with an 80's terminal like user interface.

The US is divided into 4 regions that can do electoral battle with each other. States points are based on their electoral college vote number.

Who said CSS can't be fun? Or fast.
